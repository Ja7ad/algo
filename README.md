**`algo`** is a Golang library featuring a variety of **efficient** and **well-optimized** algorithms 
designed for diverse **problem-solving needs**. 

## ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… **Optimized Performance** â€“ Algorithms are designed with efficiency in mind.  
âœ… **Modular Structure** â€“ Each algorithm is in its own package for easy use.  
âœ… **Well-Documented** â€“ Clear documentation and examples for every algorithm.  
âœ… **Tested & Benchmarked** â€“ Includes comprehensive tests and benchmarks.  


## ðŸ“š Available Algorithms

| Algorithm                                        | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [Random Weighted Selection](./rws/README.md)     | Selects items randomly based on assigned weights. Useful in load balancing, gaming, and AI. |
| [Reservoir Sampling Algorithm R](./rs/README.md) | Basic reservoir sampling, replaces elements with probability `k/i`. Efficient for uniform random sampling. |
| [Reservoir Sampling Algorithm L](./rs/README.md) | Optimized reservoir sampling for large `N`, reduces unnecessary replacements using skipping. |
| [Weighted Reservoir Sampling](./rs/README.md)    | Selects items with probability proportional to their weights using a heap-based approach. Used in recommendation systems and A/B testing. |
| [Random Sort Reservoir Sampling](./rs/README.md) | Uses a min-heap and random priorities to maintain the top `k` elements in a streaming dataset. |

## ðŸš€ Installation >= go 1.19

```shell
go get -u github.com/Ja7ad/algo
```

## âœ… Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use the **Random Weighted Selection** algorithm:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/Ja7ad/algo/rws"
)

func main() {
	// Define items with weights
	weightedItems := map[int]string{
		3: "Apple",
		1: "Banana",
		6: "Cherry",
	}

	// Create a selector
	selector, err := rws.NewWeightedSelector(weightedItems)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Pick a random item
	selectedItem, _ := selector.Pick()
	fmt.Println("Selected:", selectedItem)
}
```

For more details, check the [Random Weighted Selection documentation](./rws/README.md).
